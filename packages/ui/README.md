# `@ttrpg-cards/ui`

Presentation primitives, the card renderer, and the theme.

Wraps Radix so the rest of the workspace composes a stable interface instead of a third-party
one. **`radix-ui` is imported here and nowhere else**; switching the implementation later means
satisfying the same interface, with no change to feature or app code.

## Layout

Every primitive lives in its own directory and is imported from its named subpath:

```ts
import { Card } from "@ttrpg-cards/ui/Card";
```

The theme lives in [`src/theme.css`](./src/theme.css) and declares every colour, spacing,
typography, shape and elevation custom property, in both light and dark. **Never hardcode a
colour, a spacing or a type value.** Add a variable there instead. `apps/web/app/globals.css`
imports this file and adds only document-level resets.

## Working here

- Add a new primitive to `src/<PrimitiveName>/`, never to `apps/web`. A primitive is anything
  feature-agnostic; if two features would share a building block, it belongs here with a story
  and tests.
- Run `pnpm storybook` when adding or changing a primitive so the variant is visually
  verifiable, and add a `.stories.tsx` alongside it.
- Layout knobs go on the primitive's props, not on consumer CSS.
- Tests run in `jsdom`, configured in [`vitest.config.ts`](./vitest.config.ts). The rest of the
  workspace runs in Vitest's default Node environment.
